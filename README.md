## Predict sales for the next 6 weeks

- Background information
    > Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. 
    
- Problem statement  
    Predict daily sales for the next 6 weeks in 1115 drug stores. 
    The results will be used to plan the store’s renovation budget.

### Project overview

- Business problem and why it is import
    - Predict sales for the next 6 weeks
    - Results are necessary to plan store’s renovation budget
- Data collection
    - Download excel file
- Data cleaning
    1. Data description (how big is the problem?; statistical description)
    2. Deal with Nan and data formating
    3. Feature engineering: derivate all necessary information for exploration
    4. Data filtering according to business restrictions (e.g. variables not available during real-time prediction)
- Data exploring
    - Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to evaluate correlations, generate insights, validate hypotheses, and identify relevant variables for the model
- Modeling
    - Data preparation (rescaling, encoding, transformation)
    - Feature engineering: select most relevant variables 
    - Machine learning algorithms application: 5 models
    - Hyperparameter fining tuning
- Model performance x business implications
- Deploy and production
  
   
### Key results


### The solutions are documented in this file, and the model is available for production in this link.
